var opening_log = ["Welcome to my first game project.\n\nThis is a text-based, story-driven game. Please report any bugs or suggestions to me on koding.com. You can find a link to my account at the bottom of this\
 page.\n\nFirst thing's first. Whenever you see the cursor blinking at the end of the text here in the log, all you have to do is press the 'enter' or 'return' key to continue.\n\nGive it a shot.",
 "Good job!\n\nYou can also hit either of those keys during the 'typing out' of the text to instantly finish it, if you don't feel like waiting, or turn on the auto-skip option in the game\
 settings.", "Now if you've never played a text-based game before, it's fairly straightforward. All you have to do is enter commands into the input box whenever you have a choice to make in the game. For example, if\
 you were encountered with a door that you wanted to open, all you'd need to type is 'open door'.\n\nAs for examining things, if you have an item that you wish to see the details of, simply click on it\
 in the items section on the right; for objects within the game itself, you can type 'examine object-name' or 'look object-name' to do the same thing.\n\nWith that said, type 'start game' into the input and hit\
 'enter' or 'return' whenever you are ready to begin the game."];

//Beginning of the game
var game_start_log = ['"Is this-..."', '"..."', '"...-as hu-...-int at-..."', "A light...\n\n...", '"...-do believe-...-hear me."', "Your eyes open.\n\nYou find yourself on your back, staring up at some\
 sort of light and appear to be lying on an odd-feeling, flat surface. Your mind fades in and out of focus; as you struggle to get a grip on yourself, a voice suddenly resonates in your head:\n\n" + '"Get up."'];
var game_start_no_log = ["You ignore the voice and begin to allow yourself to regress back into unconsciousness. The voice sounds through your head again, however, more emphatically this time:\n\n" + '"Get up!"'];

var game_start2_log= ["Upon making another effort to focus, you suddenly come into complete control of yourself; your mind instantly becomes clear and you sit yourself up from where you've been lying. Examination of your\
 surroundings reveals you to be in a large, empty, four-sided room. The room itself is very plain - dimly lit, with white walls, ceiling, and floor. The only two things that stand out in your inspection are your lying\
 place and the light source above you.", "The lying place turns out not to be any kind of bed, but rather a simple, rectangular protrusion coming up a few feet from the floor. It shares the same marble white color of the\
 room's boundaries and exhibits perfect, right-angle edges on each side of the top. Despite looking to be a rather undesirable resting place, you actually find it to feel strangely comfortable, however you notice that\
 the sense of comfort doesn't appear to come from the texture of the protrusion, but rather it seems to just occur within you upon making contact with the surface, almost as if the sensation is being simulated.", "The\
 light source you find equally strange. From what you can tell, it's simply a rectangular section of the ceiling that is lit up, casting a direct light down on and around the protrusion, with no evidence of a bulb or any\
 other such thing that could be producing the light. You also notice that, even though the entire room is colored white, almost none of the light is being reflected throughout it; you can just barely make out the\
 boundaries of the room, but the protrusion remains virtually the only visible part of the place.", "As for yourself, you are completeley naked and you can't tell if it is due to the light, but your body seems to be\
 emanating a slight illumination. You raise your arms in front of you to inspect them and at first glance, you're skin appears to bear nothing strange; after a couple of moments, however, you catch a glimpse of some sort\
 of faint, white slivers running along your arms, which disappear as quickly as they appeared. You continue to stare and every so often they appear and disappear again. They are very reminiscent of veins of blood and you\
 quickly notice that they can be seen all over your body, not only on your arms."];
